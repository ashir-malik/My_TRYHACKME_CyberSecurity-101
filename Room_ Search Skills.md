## 🗒️ Room Summary  
This TryHackMe room was all about learning how to search like a professional. It taught me how to find the right information efficiently instead of wasting time scrolling through random websites. I explored how to judge whether a search result is reliable, how to use different search engines, and how to find technical information such as vulnerabilities, documentation, and even data from social media. After completing this room, I understood that searching itself is a skill that every cybersecurity learner should master.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways  
I learnt that not all search engines are the same like some are general like Google, while others like **Shodan** and **Censys** are made for technical searches.  
I also understood how to evaluate search results by checking the **source, author, and date** before trusting them.  
Searching for vulnerabilities is more effective when using trusted sources such as **CVE** database.  
I learnt that **technical documentation** is always the most accurate and official source of information about tools, commands, or protocols.  
Social media can also provide useful information, but it’s important to confirm it with reliable sources before believing it.

## 🖥️ What I Practiced  
I practiced writing specific search queries to get precise results. I also tried searching for vulnerabilities on CVE and used Shodan to see how exposed services are visible online. I compared results from normal search engines with specialized ones to understand which are more useful in certain situations.

## 💡 Why This Matters  
Learning how to search the right way saves time and makes you more confident in solving problems. In cybersecurity, it’s not just about knowing things byt rather it’s about finding them quickly and correctly. This room helped me realize that every good analyst knows **how to search before they start to fix**.
